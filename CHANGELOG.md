Version 11.4.6  (jakarta.xml.bind; parity with 8.3.2)
==============

Release date
------------

16 April 2022


Contributors to this release
----------------------------

Jason Harrop


Changes in Version 11.4.6 (multi-module)
-------------------------

11.4.6 is our first JPMS modularised release of ImportXHTML, so the jars contain module-info.class entries.

11.4.6 is compiled with Java 15, targeting Java 11.

Uses jakarta.xml.bind, rather than javax.xml.bind (hence the 11.4.x numbering); if you have existing code which imports javax.xml.bind, you'll need to search/replace across your code base, replacing javax.xml.bind  with jakarta.xml.bind

This is also a Maven multi-module project. 

From hereon, changes will generally be made to this branch first. 

Use auto-generated id value when an image is added; fixes #71, requires docx4j 11.4.6 (hence this version number)



Version 8.3.2
=============

Release date
------------

2 Dec 2021


Changes in Version 8.3.2
------------------------

Use openhtmltopdf 1.0.10; use docx4j 8.3.2

Docx4j 6.x will be the last series supporting Java 6.  
(docx4j 7.x, when released, will require Java 7+) 

This release is numbered 6.0.0 to signify it supports
Java 6, and to align with docx4j's 6.0 release.

- DivToSdt implementation: allows roundtripping of divs by ID
  See further: http://www.docx4java.org/blog/2014/09/xhtml-docx-roundtrip-content-tracking/
  and samples/DivRoundtrip.java

Convert a relative link (#) to w:hyperlink/@w:anchor (in createHyperlink method).
- Convert @id (on most elements) to bookmark
- Refactor code into new BookmarkHelper


Compatibility notes
-------------------

We will try to ensure that any formal releases of 3.2.x of docx4j and 3.2.y of ImportXHTML 
can be used together.

- https://github.com/plutext/docx4j/commit/df5d726e3359b29893153433082c13ed6c4eb56d 
  17 Sept 2014 introduces 
  
			BindingHandler bh = new BindingHandler(wordMLPackage);
			bh.setStartingIdForNewBookmarks(bookmarkId);
			
  Use of that code is commented out in the relevant samples here; those samples assume docx4j 3.2.0.
  
At some point we might add to XHTMLImporter interface in docx4j:
  
     	public AtomicInteger getBookmarkIdLast();      	
		public void setBookmarkIdNext(AtomicInteger val);
		
If we did that, a docx4j using that would need the implementation (in ImportXHTML 3.2.1 or greater).

Because a docx4j using that would not work with ImportXHTML 3.2.0, it would have to be
numbered 3.3.

But we avoid all this by leaving the XHTMLImporter interface as-is, and using that
method via reflection only.
